    // Question 1
    // Write Java statements that do the following:
    // a) Declare an arrayList nums of 15 elements of type int.
    // b) Output the value of the tenth element of the array nums.
    // c) Set the value of the 5th element of the array alpha to 99.
    // d) Set the value of the 9th element of the array alpha to the sum of the 6th and 13th elements of the array nums.




    // Question 2
    // a) create an arrayList of Strings that contain each day of the week.(starting on monday)
    // b) output each of the days of the week
    // c) output the days of the week we have class

    // b) return the largest and smallest number
    // c) return the ArrayList sorted smallest to largest
    // d) take that ArrayList see if its size is divisable by 3 and then output the ArrayList in a matrix format
    // NOTE: make the matrix n X 3 so it can be n rows by 3 columns 
    // EX. ArrayList [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    // 1 2 3
    // 4 5 6
    // 7 8 9
    // NOTE: If the ArrayList is NOT divisable by 3 ask the user for more numbers and add them until it is
    // ArrayList Size: 7
    // Please enter 2 more numbers to create the matrix...
    //
